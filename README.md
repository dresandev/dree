# Dree 🌴

## About the project

Yes, Dree like Tree 🐻‍❄️, this project could be seen as a reimplementation of the project https://tree.nathanfriend.io giving it my touch on the UI and using lighter technologies.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All credits for the logic to generate the diagram for https://gitlab.com/nfriend/, I just removed the use of lodash.
